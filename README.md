# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Website
Delves into the world of medical imaging analysis to classify brain tumor images using transfer learning architecture. Leverages pre-trained deep learning models, fine-tunes them on brain tumor image data and produces accurate classification results. From data-preprocessing to model evaluation, this project equips with the tools to make meaningful contributions to healthcare diagnostics. 
Aims to assist medical professionals by providing a reliable tool for the early detection of brain tumors using MRI images. The result is a streamlined, easy-to-use web application that processes MRI scans and delivers accurate diagnostic results.
